By looking at these visuals the viewer can get an understanding or look at information specific to novice gym goers, or the information specific to people who do a certain type of workout or even combine filters and look the cooresponding data. This dashboard could prove useful to somebody who wants to compare how thing such as consistency in the gym and experience effect the gym goers results. This data could also be used to analyze patterns and maybe even change their own routine if theres enough evidence to say that their routine is subpar."

    "- **Calories Burned:** A metric that is used to help gauge how effective a workout is\n",
    "- **Maximum/Average Heart Rate:** These indicators are used to tell the viewer how intense a workout is, this is often paired with calories burned to aim for efficiency (high calories burned with less intensity)\n",
    "- **Session Duration:** This is used to show how consistent the samples are\n",
    "- **Workout Frequency:** By factoring how many days a week somebody goes to the gym, we can assess their habits\n",
    "- **Workout Type:** Used to differentiate the workout activities that lead to higher calories burned with less intensity  \n",

    "- **Clustered Bar Chart:** Is used to compare average workout frequency by gender, and is used to highlight the difference in consistency between groups\n",

What proved to be not so challenging, but time consuming was traversing through Power BI to properly color the visuals. There were very roundabout and tedious steps taken to match the coloring of all of the backgrounds and text on the dashboard. If I were to do this again with more time I would prioritize having more diverse slicers, aside from that I am quite proud of how my dashboard ended up looking."
